# Lua RSV

RSV is the hottest, newest file format. It's like CSV but not at all like CSV.

1. Values are seperated by a new line.
2. Rows are seperated by a comma.
3. Escaping is not possible. Deal with it.

## Example

```
name
age
gender,Tangent
23
fluid,Jake (from State Farm)
30?
M (presumably)
```

Also included is the original example file [from the reference implementation](https://github.com/swordbeta/rsv).
